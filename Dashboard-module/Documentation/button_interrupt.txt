Right now the buttons are read by polling

It's better to use less CPU time with interrupts:
Example: https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/blob/release/v5.1/examples/peripherals/touch_sensor/touch_sensor_v1/touch_pad_interrupt/main/tp_interrupt_main.c#L126

Plan:
-> allocate an interrupt for each button 
-> change a global variable with the interrupt
-> take care of the global variable in a task function
